            "Enter a text to check (or type 'exit' to quit): Gujarat is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state, and he was Chief Minister there for nearly 13 years. His election to lead the national government was based significantly on the apparent success of his economic stewardship there. But people from the state have reached the point that they are willing to risk everything to go elsewhere. This reality seems to belie the prevailing narrative of prosperity.  It is not just Gujarat. A growing number of people from Punjab – India’s “breadbasket” – are also seeking a better life outside India. Though Punjab is a fertile agrarian state, unemployment is above the national average, and drug use is becoming increasingly rampant. Even as the state’s farms produce a large share of India’s food, they are unable to provide livelihoods for all the young people who depend on them.\n",
